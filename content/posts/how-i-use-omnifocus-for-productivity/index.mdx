Through the years I have tried all popular task and project management applications and services, but nothing stuck for too long. However, OmniFocus put the end to constant switching of apps and now it's basically my second brain. So, I'll try to do it and my productivity approach justice in this post.

## Productivity mindset 
I ahve gone through many productivity frameworks, they didn't stick with me for long. I tried GTD® when I was much younger, but back then it didn't make sence to me. A few years back though OmniFocus community I gave it another, more serious try. And since then, I'm a GTD® advocate. 

If you are unfamiliar with  GTD®, in essence it's a framework of capturing everything (todos, projecs, chores, ideas, someday-maybies, etc.) in your inbox, processing the inbox, turning inbox items into tasks, projects, or putting them into lists. That way, you do not have to carry around anything in your, and the todo list is always full even with small tasks (like, brush the dog, message someone, etc.) Seems, overhwelming, I know, and it was overwhelming for me at first as well. But after a while you learn how to phrase tasks correctly, how to structure projects, and it becomes a second nature. OmniFocus makes it so much easier with perspectives, tags, and scurpting. I must admit, that OmniFocus + GTD® is my second brain now, and without them, I would be in big trouble, as I forgot how to keep stuff in my mind. But that's a topic for another time. You can learn more about GTD®, [start here](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/).

## My GTD® principles in OmniFocus

### Inbox 
Inbox is the catch-all for everything, as it is supposed to be. Some things drop there automaticaly through IFTTT or Zapier integrations, other things I type up as I go through the day. Usually it is something that I want to think about later or remember to do, if it isn't already in the system. 

### Tasks 
A task is a single action. Of course, you have to be smart about it. For example, a task of changing your cat's litter is a single action, but it can easily be split into three different tasks: empty litter box, wash the litter box, fill the litter box. This granularity leads to overwhelment and nothing else. So, a task, is an action that can be completed in a relatively short time. 

### Projects & lists
Projects in GTD® represent tasks that take more than one step to accomplish. While it makes sense, if you create a project for everything that takes two or more steps, it would be quite easy to get lost in your tasks. Of course, you have to be smart about it. So, the three example taks from repvious section would not constitute a project. 

A list is container for tasks that are not assigned to any project. The purpose of the list is to group related tasks together, to give them context. For example, you would sort your chores into a "Chores" list, because "Chores" doesn't constitute a project. 

Some people also extend their GTD® networks to reading specific articles, watching movies, videos, reading books. I tried keeping all my reading and media consumption in my system, but it didn't work for me, as it removed serendipity from those areas. So, I only keep generic tasks, such as "Read a book for 30 minutes", instead of specific titles in my todo list. Of course, that only extends for pleasure tasks, as reading a specific book, chapter, watching a specific video may be part of a project. 

### Dates 
I hate deadlines. They don't make me work faster, smarter, or harder. It's something in my psychological makeup. So, I use them sparingly. Instead, I use defer dates to tackle large todo lists and projects. A defer date is a date when the task becomes available to work on or at least to be on my radar. Tasks with future defer dates do not appear on my todo list, keeping my mental space focused on available tasks or due tasks. And it helps my anxiety to stay low, because I know the task is filed in my system, scheduled, and I don't have to worry about right now. 

Review dates???

### Processes
My processes are quite simple, compared to others in GTD® and OmniFocus communities. My day starts with skimming my Inbox in case there are new tasks that need to be sorted and worked on today. Usually, there aren't. Then I review the task list for the day. During the review I defer some tasks for later day to batch similar tasks in one day, or split large tasks into smaller parts to prevent overwhelment. I delete tasks that became outdated, redundant, irrelevant. 

During the day I work on tasks, and everything that I do not have to take care of urgently goes into the inbox. In the evening, I review what I accomplished during the day for closure. A shutdown routine to complete the execution of task list. Then I review the inbox, sort the tasks into appropriate projects and lists. I set the defer date for the tasks without defer date, and set due dates where needed. Then, I plan the next day's todo list. In the morning review I don't give deep thought to the tasks. In the evening planning routine, I think deeper about the projects and tasks, and how to distribute time and energy effectively during the day. I don't schedulte most of my tasks, but rather assign time limits to the tasks so I would have an idea how my time will be distributed tomorrow. Of course, a lot of the time there is just too much that I want to do during the day, so many tasks get defered to later date, or assigned a lower priority in case I have fee time (more on that below). 

Every Sunday I do my weekly review routine. 

## Personal flavours and scripting

### Project structure
My approach to project structure is quite simple. There are folders representing important areas of life (i.e. Financials, Health, Aesthetics, Fun, Learning, Work, House, Business, Writing, Transport). Each contains related projects and task lists. Some folders have subfolders, which represent very long projects, such as house renovation. Even though the house renovation could be a project with sub-projects, I much rather have many smaller one-level projects in a folder, as seeng the same project over and over feels like there is no progress. 

### Tags and priorities 
This is where it gets interesting. 

### Perspectives 
I use four built-in perspectives: Inbox, Forecast, Projects, Review. I use Forecast for planning and Review for weekly review. 

### Scripts
