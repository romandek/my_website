*It's no secret that everyone hates corporate meetings and the whole culture in and around them. But can it be better? Can _we_ make it better?*

***

Corporate meetings culture sucks. We have meetings, and meetings about meetings, and meetings about scheduling meetings, ceremonies, town halls, workshops, you name it. They spawn like gremlins after midnight. 

Yes, we need meetings. They are a tool like any other. The proverbial golden hammer for every problem. But why?! Why do we keep booking meetings that could have been emails? Why do we keep beating around the bush during said meetings? Why do we feel uncomfortable to speak up? 

Think about it. We are creatives, our job is to think deeply. When are we supposed to have a long focused block of time to work, if we keep being interrupted by meetings? Or maybe it's us? Maybe we dig out a hole by accepting every meeting? Maybe we have unaddressed issues that make us uncomfartable to say _no_ to a meeting, so we end up with crazy calendars? 

Regardless of that, most meetings are distractions. We don't need to be in any of them. Meetings are tools for:
- Information exchange 
- Building relationships 
- Socialisation

But do these things happen during most meetings? How often do you leave a meeting feeling smarter, more informed? How often do you feel that you got just a little closer with your colleagues? How often do you feel that itch of human connection scratched? Don't know about you, but I rarely do feel these things. 

Meetings are just something we do. We book them subconsciously, and we _participate_ in them subconsciously. An endless slew of gatherings of half-present colleagues. WHen was the last time you had a purposeful meeting with fully-engaged participants? When did the meeting end with its goal attained? 

I think, I know what's the issue here. Culture. Well, a lack thereof. Let's dig deeper.

Nobody taught us how to do meetings. We, as species, went from the old-timey meetings straight to one-click scheduling in less than two decades. From arranging a meeting long in advance, diligent preparations, dressing up, to a frictionless and hence thoughtless booking. From a mental pattern honed by centuries of practice to no-brainer meetings. Our monkey brains simply had no time to rewire. And you know what happens if we are not taught nor inherit the wisdom of ages and have to suddenly start practicing new behaviour? Monkey brains take over and we resort to our primal instincts.

Let's be radically honest: when was the last time you considered why you are booking the meeting? Not the purpose, but _why_? Why not just write an email? Is it necessary to gathering a forum? Or because you book meetings instictually? 

And the worst part: too many of the meetings are a waste of time. Even with the best intentions, sometimes nothing productive happens. No decisions are made, just plans to schedule new meetings. 

It's not our fault, though! We weren't taught these things. Parents and schools didn't pass down wisdom of corporate meetings to us because it didn't exist before. 

Unfortunately, it's hard resisitng the mokey brains. Thye will take over any area of life you don't control it. And mokey brains are not smart. They are reactive, they do as the monkey do. 

A double whammy, is that monkey is incompatible with human institutions. That behaviour may have worked for neanderthal societies, as the most complex aspect of their lives were tending to their young, procuring food, and occasional tribe wars. 

I hope you can see what I am trying to say. Silence the monkey, and embrace the complexity of modern world. Take time to think about your behaviours. 

Also! This corporate meetings plight is a software problem. You see, software is an abstraction and it only exists in the context of hardware *and* people. It's a socio-technical _system_. The software is designed for people with the assumption that people know what they are doing. When in reality very few of us question our ways. For the most part, it works out well. But not for corporate software.

Business software is designed for businesses, not for people. It is designed to be flexible enough to meet as wide a market need as possible and to maximise the revenue from the software. It's a tool. There's an assumption that we know how to properly use it. Surprise, we don't. We weren't taught that, and we're too busy to stop and learn. 

Corporate calendar software providers are financially disincentivized from reinforcing the culture of fewer, more meaningful meetings. Otherwise it would come with extensive writings on how to have good meetings. So it ends up reinforcing our instincts, not the productivity we need. 

_**So, what do?**_

I think we owe it to ourselves to be more introspective. Reflect on how and why you schedule meetings, how you host and participate in meetings. Start conversations with your colleagues about the meeting culture and what everyone could do to make it less misearble. Once you figure something out, try practicing it and will catch on in the team, department, and organisation.
