## The Quick Version

Our mission is to provide safe and productive learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender expression and identity, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, political opinions, and anything else that can be deemed unrelated to the event. We do not tolerate any harassment online and offline media, and in-person. Any speech, imagery, or representation that violates the above conditions may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund at the discretion of the staff.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender expression and identity, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, political opinions, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Attending parties, asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Any party engaging in harassing behaviour will be warned, and any nonconformity will be prosecuted by any measures the staff deem appropriate, icluding expulsion without a refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately. 

The staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect al parties to follow these rules at every event and platform.
