Through the years I have tried all mainstream task and project management applications and services, but nothing stuck for too long. Some of the apps created more tension than they removed from my life, and some I couldn't stand looking at for long periods of time. I had a fling with one app, returned to a previous one, then tried a new one, and so it went for a good part of the last decade. At some point, I rediscovered OmniFocus, and it stuck with me ever since. But I'm not here to talk about the app; I'm here to share the philosophy, the way I think about tasks in my work and personal life. 

## The philosophy

### The humble beginnings

I started putting tasks that I wanted and needed to do down back in school. Yes, you can skip this paragraph, but I digress. I often forgot to do some chores for my parents, some agreements with friends, some homework things. Not because I am forgetful, but I am not focused. So I wrote to-do lists. Don't even remember what was the first app that I used for it, but I definitely avoided using pen and paper. 

### The dark ages

Over time the simple to-do lists became useless: the tasks became more complex, and seemingly popped out of nowhere. Maybe I was too involved in everything, maybe it's Maybelline. I needed to handle that complexity. The lists didn't ever end and waking up in the morning to the to-do list was not something I looked forward to. The solution was: try a new app. Wunderlist, Todoist, Teuxdeux, Milk, Any.do, Doist, Asana, Trello, Google Keep, Evernote, I Done This—I tried them all. As I mentioned, I would use each app for months then switch to another one when I notice that my productivity suffers. Some apps were objectively great, but that didn't help. and it went for years—burnout after burnout. 

### The enlightenment

Then I discovered OmniFocus. The logic behind this app forced me to reconsider how I view my tasks, and forced me to revisit GTD® principles. I hate how this sounds like I'm a productivity guru. But bear with me, and I'll try to explain how to think about the task management.

## The basics

The system is simple and consists of: an inbox, projects, tasks, and buckets. The inbox is a catchall for all incoming tasks, a project is a container for tasks, and a bucket is a container for tasks. Let's dig deeper. 

### What is a task

To put it simply, a task is a single action. An action has clear starting and end states of the object or system it is applied to. And action can be scheduled and deferred for later. An action can also be easily delegated. It's up to you how granular you want to be with your tasks. From practice, I can say, that the granularity of actions may vary across different life situations, and what important to keep in mind that the action has a start, an end, and a result. 

Examples

### What is a project

As mentioned, a project is a container for tasks. Think of a project as a complex task that takes multiple steps until the desired goal is reached. It's up to you how granular you want your project tasks to get. I learned pretty fast that very detailed tasks do not work for me. 

A project has a deadline and a goal. A project without a deadline is a bucket (more on those below). A project without a well-defined goal is a fantasy. More so, a project unifies tasks, it gives them context. Most of the desired changes we want to see in our work and personal life are very complex, and often we forget why we are doing the task now, the bigger picture is not always known or remembered. A project solves that problem. When we define a goal in terms of a project with very specific tasks, it becomes easier to track the progress, know why you need to do the tasks, and know what are the next steps. 

I know project might associate with different things for different people. But it's just a word, it is not referencing anything else that it is. A project is a goal with a deadline you want to reach it by. A deadline can be tomorrow, and a deadline can be in two years—it doesn't matter. All that matters that you know the edges of it—when it will end and what you want to change with it. 

Examples

### What is a bucket

A bucket is a project that is indefinite. It gives context to its tasks and nothing more. For example, a bucket named *Bills* will contain tasks to pay bills, to ask about bills, to get the bills, and so on. There will always be bills to pay, so using a project here is not appropriate. However, a project to move house might have a task related to bills, and that task should stay in that project as it only exists in that context. When a tasks is repetitive, or one-off action, it's better to use buckets. 

Examples

### What is inbox

Until now everything was pretty simple. Now where does the management of those tasks start? And it starts in the inbox. Once you think of a task or an idea you don't want to explore on the spot, or a reminder for later, you put it in the inbox. Then once in a while you go through your inbox and refine the items into the projects. Sounds rigid, I know, but in reality it isn't that rigid. Sometimes you aren't as busy in the moment and you know the exact project or bucket you want to put that item in. The other times you just don't want to loose your current train of thought, so you put the task in the inbox. Moreover, you can go through your inbox each hour, once or thrice a day—it's all up to you, your schedule, mental capacity, and urgency of the tasks. 

## The not-basics

### Everything is a task or a project

And I mean it. Everything can be formulated into a task. Just look at this list: 

* Call mom
* Make bed
* Buy eggs
* Scrub the pans
* Water plants 
* Clean my room
* Declutter the closet
* Analyse the project expenses
* Contact the country representatives 
* Create a script for data analytics
* Restructure the code 
* Meet with Jebediah Zebrapants
* Handover the materials 
* Prepare presentation
* Present the presentation

Now you see, that literally everything can be formulated as a task. Some might be vague and expansive, some are short, clear and sweet. A task doesn't necessarily mean one short action, but sometimes it might be helpful to divide a task into more manageable smaller tasks to avoid overwhelment. You will get a feel what works for you and what doesn't in terms of formulating tasks the more you use this approach. 

But what then is the difference between a chonky task and project? A project has a defined goal and has multiple taks. A project is something that cannot be done in one sitting. If it can—it's a task. For example:

```markdown
Project: Contact country representatives
  Task: Write the email
  Task: Send the email 

Task: Contact country representatives
```

```markdown
Project: Declutter the closet 
  Task: Sort through winter clothes
  Task: Sort through summer clothes 
  Task: Sort through underwear and socks 
  Task: Sort through footwear 
  Task: Donate clothes to charity 
  
Task: Declutter the closet
```

```markdown
Task: Fix the team dynamics

Project: Fix the team dynamics
  Task: Think of group building activities
  Task: Run a poll on tram-building activities
  Task: Book the venue and catering
  Task: Book the entertainment 
  .
  .
  .
```

In the first case, it is more appropriate to have one task in your list instead of creating a project. Chances are that you can easily write the email and send it in once sitting. Even when distracted you get back to the task and you know what you need to do and where you stopped. In the second case, however setting up a project makes much more sense. I don't know about you, but I can't declutter my closet in one sitting—it's too overwhelming. But if I set up a project, with the goal of having more manageable, clean, and updated wardrobe, with multiple steps it doesn't matter when I finish it. All that matters chip at it finishing each task whenever I have time for it. Because we naturally want to have tasks finished in one sitting, decluttering a closet or something else of similar or greater complexity might be overwhelminf and demotivating. In the thid case, while the one task is noble and all, it's wiser to create a project instead with less ambiguos tasks. The point being that this intent is just too complex to manage all oving parts effectively and with peaceful mind. 

### Deadlines

Speaking of finishing stuff. Be careful with deadlines. Deadline has a rather bloody history: suring US Civil War, a deadline was a line in prisons which prisoners could not cross at the threat of being shot. A modern use of deadline, meaning the date and time one can not cross at the threat of derailing the plans, is much less bloody, but still pertains the same idea. 

Deadlines are supposed to be absolute, despite what the micromanagers in our lives have conditioned us to think. A due date should never be used for planning when you want to finish the task. A due date must be an imperative date, not a motivation for you to finish something by some date. Missing a due date must have real reprecussions, and not be "oh well, I'll finish it by next week". Believe me, there are only very few tasks that need due dates in your life. You will be much more productive without every project and task having due date. Of course, it's okay to have a *date when I* want *this to be finished*, but don't treat it like a due date or vice versa. 

### Tending to your tasks

Every system needs some maintenance once in a while. As mentioned, you will need to gro through your inbox at least once a day to keep your tasks assigned to projects and buckets. Of course, at first there will be mistakes made, duplicate tasks, but with the maturation of your system this will become less of an issue. 

As in every system, there will be some degree of entropy in this system. There will be stale tasks and projects. You will need to review all projects on a monthly, quarterly, biannual basis. Not that overwhelming to spend a few hours every so often, if you think about it. And this maintenance task can even be a recurring task in the Maintenance bucket. 

Some projects may become redundant, stale, unneeded, some will need to be paused until later. And this is all good. We are trying to create the second brain, the system is a living thing. Change must be managed and embraced. 

### Ownership

This whole approach is all about radical ownership of tasks. Even if you are not the direct owner of the task, but want to keep tabs on it, you own the "Check on.." task in your personal system. I know this sounds like a fledgling manager's wet dream, they might get the satisfaction, but it's better for your own sanity. You own the system (and if you work in the team, you own it just as much as everyone else does). 

The thing with productivity, is that we need systems; systems that we can uses, analyse, and improve. Why spend mental energy adjusting things in your head, when you can actually do work you like? And let your task system do the thinking for you? 

## Mapping the thinking to the frameworks

### Scrum 

Sprints in essence is a batching of tasks ([if done right](https://www.romandek.com/notes/scrumming-without-a-goal)). It's not a project nor a bucket. It's a tool for managing priorities. User stories, however are equal to projects. A well-defined user story has clear edges and a end date (even if it is without a due date). Every tasks must belong to a user story. Think about it: every development task has a goal, and even most bugfixes are within a context of a specific user story. Tasks that have no user story can have a miscellaneous ongoing user story (a bucket). Epics can be thought of as a project of projects. Not necessarily relevant, but they help to see the bigger picture of user stories. 

Yes, the full-scrum operation is very complicated, ceremonies are sometimes ovewhelming, but the barebones scrum does adhere to the principles project, bucket, task. 

### Kanban 

It's a bit more complicated to map the projects in Kanban. This framework is not suited to manage projects per se, more to oversee that the tasks of the project are moving forward. Of course, if there is some software that allows sub-tasks, a project can be reimagined as the sup-task which is not done until all sub-tasks are moved to done. 

Kanban is not meant for having a big picture view. It's a factory line framework. It's not useful for managing complexity. No offence. 

### GTD 

The task, bucket, project approach is inspired by GTD framework. All the ceremonies and task management rituals are not essential, but the principles are almost identical. GTD lists are projects and buckets, and tasks are tasks. System maintenance and inbox processing in principle matches. 

## Finishing thoughts

Hopefully, I relayed the task-thinking clearly. It's not a complicated philosophy, but a very useful one. It will be hard to rewire the thining at first (it was for me!) But eventually, you will get a hang of it. 

The beauty of this approach is that it's a robust system, withstands stress tests and is relatively easy to manage. I hope, you will use it well.
