Through the years I have tried all mainstream task and project management applications and services, but nothing stuck for too long. Some of the apps created more tension than they removed from my life, and some I couldn't stand looking at for long periods of time. I had a fling with one app, returned to a previous one, then tried a new one, and so it went for a good part of the last decade. At some point, I rediscovered OmniFocus, and it stuck with me ever since. But I'm not here to talk about the app; I'm here to share the philosophy, the way I think about tasks in my work and personal life.
