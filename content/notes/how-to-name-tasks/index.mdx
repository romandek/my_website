Sometimes I procrastinate with engaging with my task list. I suspect because sometimes the tasks don't sound clear enough to understand what is expected and what the result is. That's why I came up with a naming scheme for the tasks. My main framework for tasks management is GTD®, so I prefix my tasks with action verbiage that lets me know what action I need to take to finish the task. It fits well in the bigger picture of projects. 

**Prepare for** — tasks that need me to prepare materials, a speech for a meeting, event, a presentation

**Waiting for** — blocker tasks that remind me to check in with people and companies if I'm waiting for something (feedback, materials, a delivery)

**Respond to** — tasks that tell me that I need to respond to someone that I didn't respond to instantly (probably because it wasn't urgent or needed deeper consideration)

**Look into** — tasks for googling or doing light research about a topic for general knowledge, usually very low priority

**Research** — tasks that require deeper research about a specific topic

**Think about** — tasks for pondering, not quite analysis

**Schedule** — tasks to scheduling the appointments

**Decide** — tasks that require a strategic decision 

**Call/message/email X** — tasks to start a conversation with someone

**Read** — tasks to read an article, a book

**Buy/order** — tasks to order or buy products or services

**Analyse/compare/evaluate** — tasks that need a careful, often multi-faceted consideration

**Draft** — tasks to write a draft of a note, a post, a chapter

**Review** — tasks to critically examine tasks or drafts

**Finalize** — tasks for wrapping up with a project

**Update** — tasks to update something longterm (a contract, a project)

**Send/submit** — tasks to send a package or submit documents 

**Edit** — tasks to edit a draft

**Publish** — tasks to publish the edited draft 

The rest of the task name usually describes the object of the action: a post, a note, a package, a person, a concept. I try to keep the task names short and descriptive. 

This is not an exhaustive list of verbs, but these are the verbs I try to limit myself to; too much of variety creates overwhelm and confusion. There's another pattern I use for phrasing the project names.
