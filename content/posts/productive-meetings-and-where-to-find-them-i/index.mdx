*Modern office culture is incredibly fascinating. To observe. From the inside. Particularly, meetings and productivity culture. In this blog post, I will dissect the meetings culture.*

No one in their right mind, I think, will say that they enjoy corporate meetings. In pre- and pandemic times. And they are right. Corporate meeting culture sucks.

We have meetings, and meetings about past meetings, and meetings about scheduling meetings. Then there are ritual meetings, ad-hoc meetings, and information push meetings. Then the crown jewel of bad meetings: the quasi-workshop and decision-making meeting, when the experts and non-experts concoct something in real-time. And, of course, don't forget meetings with your manager. At least half of those meetings could have been an email, a memo in an intranet, an IM message. I'm not wrong.

Yes, we need meetings. But not like _this_! When people, whose job is to think deeply, are supposed to work? Deep work, like quality sleep, must go through stages; no one can just simply jump from meeting mode to deep thinking mode. I think you are intimately acquainted with the feeling when you can't focus no matter how hard you try to will it otherwise.

And this distraction costs us—the employees—our mental and emotional energy. We become disenfranchised with our work, our performance at work faster than it should be. Moreover, this costs a lot of money for the employer.

And you know why this is? Culture. Well, a lack thereof. Let's dig deeper.

Nobody taught us how to have meetings. We, as species, went from the old-timey meetings straight to one-click meeting scheduling in less than two decades. From arranging a meeting long in advance, preparing the materials, the venue, dressing up, distributing the agenda to invitees, to click-and-drag scheduling. From a pattern honed by centuries of experience to no-frills no-brainer meetings. Our monkey brains simply had no time to rewire. And you know what happens if we are not taught nor inherit the wisdom of ages? Monkey brains take over and we resort to our primal instincts.

Be honest: when was the last time you considered why you are booking the meeting? Not the purpose, but _why_? Why not just write an email? Is it because you genuinely require gathering a forum or because it is instinctual? Just like our neanderthal progenitors gathered ad-hoc to _talk_ things over?

It's not our fault, though! We weren't taught these things. The new ways just don't permeate the western culture the same way the old ages-old ways do. And the wisdom of our forefathers is in our DNA. And we are doomed to resort to the behaviour that is natural if we don't have learned behaviours.

It's also a software problem. You see, software is an abstraction and it only exists in the context of hardware *and* people. It's a socio-technical system. The software is designed for people with the assumption that people know what they are doing. When in reality very few of us question our ways. For the most part, it works out well. But not for corporate software.

Business software is designed for businesses, not for people. It is designed to be flexible enough to meet as wide a market need as possible and to maximise the revenue from the software.

Corporate calendar software providers are financially disincentivized from reinforcing the culture of fewer, more meaningful meetings. And if we don't learn the culture nor from our parents, schools, workplaces, nor are we conditioned by software, what are we to do? We resort to the primal impulses. And calendar software makes it extremely easy to do just that. Just a few clicks.

So, what do?

Of course, start with looking into your own habits and behaviours. Once you figure yourself out, suggest changes to your team. You won't change the corporate culture, but changing your team's view of meetings will be the domino that tips over the others. People leaving the team may even carry it to other parts of the organisation, and even other companies. And suddenly, there is hope.

*This is part one of a two-part essay on productivity meetings. This was the conceptual, introductory setup for the second post. The next part will be about practical actions we can take to start changing our meeting culture.*
