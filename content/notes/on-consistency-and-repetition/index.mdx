You become what you do over and over. Repetition is key. That's how apprentices become masters. This also applies to the mind. Your thinking patterns is the result of repeated thoughts. 

In social theory, there's a concept of normlasisation â€” a novel behaviour slowly becomes normal if not challenged by the social group. At first, said behaviour might seem strange, outlandish, but over time with repetition it becomes _normal_. 

So consistency and repetition is key to changing yourself and your surroundings.
