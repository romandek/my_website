Through the years I have tried all mainstream task and project management applications and services, but nothing stuck for too long. Some of the apps created more tension than they removed from my life, and some I couldn't stand looking at for long periods of time. I had a fling with one app, returned to a previous one, then tried a new one, and so it went for a good part of the last decade. At some point, I rediscovered OmniFocus, and it stuck with me ever since. But I'm not here to talk about the app; I'm here to share the philosophy, the way I think about tasks in my work and personal life. 

## The philosophy 

### The humble beginnings

I started putting tasks that I wanted and needed to do down back in school. Yes, you can skip this paragraph, but I digress. I often forgot to do some chores for my parents, some agreements with friends, some homework things. Not because I am forgetful, but I am not focused. So I wrote to-do lists. Don't even remember what was the first app that I used for it, but I definitely avoided using pen and paper. 

### The dark ages

Over time the simple to-do lists became useless: the tasks became more complex, and seemingly popped out of nowhere. Maybe I was too involved in everything, maybe it's Maybelline. I needed to handle that complexity. The lists didn't ever end and waking up in the morning to the to-do list was not something I looked forward to. The solution was: try a new app. Wunderlist, Todoist, Teuxdeux, Milk, Any.do, Doist, Asana, Trello, Google Keep, Evernote, I Done This—I tried them all. As I mentioned, I would use each app for months then switch to another one when I notice that my productivity suffers. Some apps were objectively great, but that didn't help. and it went for years—burnout after burnout. 

### The enlightenment

Then I discovered OmniFocus. The logic behind this app forced me to reconsider how I view my tasks, and forced me to revisit GTD® principles. I hate how this sounds like I'm a productivity guru. But bear with me, and I'll try to explain how to think about the task management.
