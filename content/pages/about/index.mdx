# Hi, I'm Roman! ðŸ‘‹

I'm data scientist, software developer, and teacher. I was born in 1991 in Lithuania, spent my most of my years here (except for that one semester in Austria). I went to <a href="https://www.mruni.eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MRU</a> and <a href="https://www.jku.at" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JKU</a> where I studied software development and artificial intelligence. 

Since uni, I've been developing Microsoft Dynamics AX (Later Dynamics 365 F&O) modifications, became a certified Microsoft expert, but still didn't right. So, in 2020 finally I decided to change career path and become a data scientist. 

**I'm open to data scientist opportunities**. On the side, I am maintaining this website and a few other [projects](/projects).
