# Hi, I'm Roman! ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a business analyst in the financial sector. Previosuly, I was a data scientist and software development. I was born in 1991 in Lithuania, spent my most of my years here (except for that year in Austria). I went to [MRU](https://www.mruni.eu/ "Link to Mykolas Romeris University web page") and [JKU](https://www.jku.at "Link to Johannes Kepler UniversitÃ¤t web page") where I studied software development and artificial intelligence. 

Since uni, I've been developing Microsoft Dynamics AX (Later Dynamics 365 F&O) modifications, became a certified Microsoft expert, but still wasn't happy. So, in 2020 finally changed my career path to data science and business analysis.

**I'm open to data scientist side projects**. On the side, I am maintaining this website and a few other [projects](/projects).
