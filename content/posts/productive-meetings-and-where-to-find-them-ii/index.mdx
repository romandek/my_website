Modern office culture is incredibly fascinating. To observe. From the inside. Particularly, I find the meetings and productivity interesting subjects to study. 

Meetings are interesting buggers. Long, short, mostly parasitic, they form symbiotic relationships with the hosts, who then spread spores and new meetings are born. You find them in every nook and cranny of the organisation. No one is safe. 

This is a socio-technical problem.

Involuntary distractions are the real problems.

in Groups if we do not address some behaviours, they are defaulted to the most common, usually neanderthal instinct. 

## Let's look at what a meeting is

In theory, a meeting is a span of time spent in conversation with other people with a specific outcome in mind. In practice, it's a block of time spent in conversation with other people without a specific outcome. Well, talking is an outcome in itself. 

From my experience, I have noticed a few types of meetings. Let's look at each of them. 

A proper meeting is a meeting with a specific agenda, a single goal, good structure. Everyone comes prepared, have opinions and arguments that will add to the goal of the meting. Most importantly, everyone is a relevant expert, and non-experts are aware of the fact that they are non-experts. 

The second common meeting type is the team meeting. Usually, these are meant for building team moral and keeping everyone updated about things happening in the team and to the team. It's a social meeting. Not to be confused with progress update meetings and huddles. 

Progress update meetings and huddles are short, structured meetings, designed to have everyone in the loop about what everyone did, is doing, and will do. They are a necessary evil. They are not meant to be social. 

Meetings for making decisions are an interesting kind. They are the reflection of democracy. Yet, every other meeting pretends to be a decision making meeting. THis meetign requires expertise, preparation, and rigorous structure. 

Solve a problem meetings. Tehy are designed to inform each other about a progreblem (can be done in an email) and agree on the appropriate actions. Can be dove over an email, but sometimes meeting is more effective.

Get feedback. The worst of meetings. As a rule, you need preparation for these meetings, unless you are na expert on top on the matters and can easily wing through these meetings. And most of us aren't experts who need to be in those meetings. Feedback is not about getting opinions from as many people as possible. It's about collecting constructive ideas. 

Generate ideas. Quantity matters. 

Make a plan 

Reflect and improve 

BUild relationships 

Can't self-motivate/procrastination 

Share information 

Don't know other ways to collaborate 


Yet in modern office culture it's quite differet. It's almost perversive. The technology removed all the barriers, streamlined many things, to the extent that anyone can steal a chunk of time out of your day with a few mouseclicks. And now there is no time before or after the meetings, it's all same brown mass meetings and time between meetings. Somehow we must find time to work. 

So you prepare at home (do you realize how crazy this is?), or do the preparation and catching up during the meetings? Just like you did Maths homework in school before the class. Your catching up distracts everyone from the goal of the meeting, and out of the hour-long meeting you have maybe 10 minutes doing the actual meeting. 

And so a modern office culture across the corporate world is just the A meeting about another meeting and then a meeting to review the meetings.

Ten people cooking the soup together. Do you realize how crazy this is? Not every thing requires your input. The rule of experts, not making bland things together. 


## I'm not a monster

Our expectations and social-ness 

Adressing the virus in the room. Pandemic created even more overhead. People feel left out, lonely. And that's not great. That's why you need to schedule catchup meetings, coffee meetings with colleagues, and not take it out on the meetings that actually need to be useful. 

Uncertainty 


## What a meeting should be

Meeting types: Team, Project/Progress/Update, Decision, Call 

A meeting is a tool. And I impore you to look at meetings like the tools they are. 

Each meeting has one and only one goal. 

You can try to localiz work to happen in the meetings, but you will fail. None of us are experts enough to wing it. And When everyone in the meeting is winging it, nothing good happens.
